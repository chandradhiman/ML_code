#how to know which dataset is good and important.

1. Relevance to the Problem
    a.  dataset contiain feature(input) and target??
        eg -  spam detection model? i need email text + spam labels (yes/no)

2. Data Quality 
    a. Completness
    b. Accuracy
    c. Consistency

3. Dataset Size - we have to enough dataset beacuse its help to improve model performance.

4. Feature Richness - help to contribute to predictions.
    eg - if predicting house prices, a datadet with location, size, bedroom, crime rate is better than one with only size.

5. Diversity and Bias - Does the dataset represent the real world population. 
    eg - A facial recogition dataset with only one ethnicity will fail for others.

6. Availability & legality - is the dataset open source. (kaggle, google Dataset)

7. Ease of access & preprocessing - must be imported into your system (CSV, JSON, SQL)?, or is feature engineering required?

8. Histogram, heat map,
